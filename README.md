# STREAMELEMENTS WIDGETS
We've created some Widgets that you can integrate with your own StreamElements overlays! Keep checking back as I'll be adding more widgets as I create them.

*All instructions on how to use are included in all README.md files*

## Channel Points
**Sound Player** - Play sounds when channel points are redeemed.

**Video Player** - Play videos on-screen when channel points are redeemed.

## Chat
**Greeter** - Show an on-screen welcome message when a viewer types in chat for the first time!
