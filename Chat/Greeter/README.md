This widget will show an on-screen welcome message to users that type in chat for the first time!

## HOW TO ADD TO YOUR OVERLAY
To add this widget to your overlay, follow these steps:

1. Go to StreamElements, sign in and go to *My Overlays* in the left-hand menu.
2. Click *Edit* on an existing overlay you would like to add this widget to **or** select *Create Blank Overlay* in the top-right.
3. Click the circular *+* button at the bottom of the screen and select *Static / Custom* -> *Custom Widget*
4. Click the new widget that has appeared in your overlay and click *Settings* in the left-hand menu.
5. Click *Open Editor*
6. Replace *all* of the code in the **HTML** tab with the code inside the *iphone.html* file in this repository.
7. Replace *all* of the code in the **CSS** tab with the code inside the *iphone.css* file in this repository.
8. Replace *all* of the code in the **JS** Tab with the code inside the *iphone.js* file in this repository.
9. Replace *all* of the code in the **Fields** tab with the code inside the *iphone.json* file in this repository.
10. Delete *all* of the code inside the **Data** tab.
11. Click *Done* in the bottom-right.

## Settings
**Branding** - Customise the look and feel of the widget.

**Display** - Customise the duration and layout of each message.

**Messages** - Set usernames to ignore (such as bots or your own channel) and up to 5 messages to randomly select for each new user.

Adjust the **Width/Height** and **Position** using *Settings* -> *Position, size and style*. 
I'd recommend setting the width to the same width as the overlay canvas, but this is not necessary.
