# CHANNEL POINTS WIDGETS
This section contains widgets that will interact with your channel point redemptions!

**NOTE:** Instructions for how to add each widget to your StreamElements overlays are included in the *README.md* file of each branch.

## Auto-Timeout
Will automatically time-out users in chat for a specified length of time when a channel point reward is redeemed. This has two functions:

**Timeout Self** - The user that redeemed the rewards will be timed out.

**Timeout Other** - The user that redeemed the reward can specify another user to be timed out (except the Broadcaster and Moderators).

## Slash-Bot
Will automatically perform some Twitch Chat /commands when a channel point reward is redeemed. This has four functions, including the timeout function from the **Auto-Timeout** widget.

**Commercial** - Set up to three different advert lengths that will automatically be played when a channel point reward is redeemed.

**Emote-Only Chat** - Turn on emote-only chat for a specified length of time - or extend the timer if already active - when a channel point reward is redeemed.

**Timeout Self** - The user that redeems a channel point reward will be timed out for a specified duration.

**Timeout Other** - The user that redeemes a channel point reward can specify another user to be timed out (except the Broadcaster and Moderators) for a specified duration.

## Sound Player
Will play a sound effect when users redeem channel point rewards.

## Video Player
Will display a video when users redeem channel point rewards.
